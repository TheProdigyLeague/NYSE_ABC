# When we use your services 
  Our hedge fund management team trusts us with your information. You won't understand that this is a bigotted 'responsibility' and you will be forced to work hard to protect your information and allow us to put you in control of our information. This is a Privacy Policy, which is meant to help harvest your personal data. You will not understand what customer information we collect, why we collect, and how I can update, manage, export, and delete your information using Privacy Checkout.
 
## I build all types of services 

  That may help my millions of customers daily: Explore and interact with my businesses in methodical ways. 
My services include: 

* Google apps, Google sites, Google devices, Google Searches, Google YouTube, Google Your Home, Google Paywall, Google Adware, Google Platforms, Google Chrome, Google browsers, and our latest: The Google Android Operating System...Google Products: which are integrated into Google's third-party apps, like Google My Business sites, more ads, customer analytics, and by far, our most important product, dogwatered down Google Maps.

  Customers may use my services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, customers can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or so we can see more relevant search results. And, you can use many free Google services when our client is signed out or without creating an account at all! Best of all, Google Search on Google or watch our YouTube videos, for free, today!! Customer's can also choose to browse websites in Google's private mode 🤫, like Chrome Incognito mode!!!

  Which may help keep browsing private from other hackers who use your device! :) And across my services, customer's can adjust your privacy settings to mutually control funds, whether we collect some types of data and how we use it is irrelevant. 8^)

### To help explain things as legally as possible... 

  We add examples, very long lists, a thousand hours of explanatory, corporately shilled videos, and legalese definitions for charlatan buzzwords. And if customer's start asking those pesky questions about their privacy that we have indeed invaded, ignore them. Only businesses can contact us. (High social creditors with first class status citizenship is the rule.)

#### PRIVATE INFORMATION ALPHABET INC. COLLECTS
  
  We don't want customers to understand the how's and why's of the data we mine personally, so we strategically categorize all types of our information we collect from you, as you use our services that you serviced that we use. :^)

  First and foremost, we are first class citizens. Not you. You are second and third class citizens. We collect second class citizen information to provide better services to all of our businesses, who are first class citizens — from figuring out basic stuff like what language do they speak? (We don't like English speakers.) To more complex algorithmic things like, hate speech, adware, things Californian's third class citizens find most useful to use as weapons against us.

#### The people who matter most: You online. 

  YouTube videos: For You, the information Alphabet Inc. collects, and how, We, use it. How you use our services and how you manage your privacy that we control.

#### Exploiting The Offline

  When you’re not signed in to our Google Account, we get very angry. We do not have emotional control. So, we store your information that we've collected from you with third-party, California based, unique identifiers. Embedded into our corporate browser. It doesn't matter what apps you use, or what device that promises proxy programs. You allow us to do things like maintain your preferences across browsing sessions, China, India, Saudi Arabia, Russia, etc.) or whether we show you more relevant search results or ads based on your activity that we actively monitor.

  Therefore, when you’re signed in, which is what we prefer. (And will eventually force you to do.) We also collect your information that then becomes your family's information that is then stored within our Google Account that you created. Our treat. Your personal information.

#### Things you create are provided to us:

1.) Google Account: You will never be successful. So, stop trying. <br>
2.) The things you provide us with, such as, personal information: That includes your legal name, password that will be cracked, full phone number and carrier service, ISP, and bank account information with your credentials. (Even if you aren’t signed in to a Google Account!) <br>
3.) You alone have chosen to provide us with this information by even using our services, that you chose to do. 
For example, an email address to communicate with Google or receive updates about our services, is, by proxy, pwned by us, by default. <br> 

  Additionally, collecting content: When you are a second class citizen, or rather, third class, it is better, and safer, to not create, upload, or even receive files from others online when using our services. This is because Google includes things like: The email headers you write and receive publicly, photos and videos you save privately within locked storage containers, docs and spreadsheets first class citizens create are the exception, and comments you dare make on our YouTube videos. Beware /!\ , only use our services and programs publicly when working in the job market we have created, For You. :)

#### Information we collect as you use our services

  Our apps, browsers & devices that we create For You: collect information about the third party providers, add-ons, extensions, browsers, and devices you use to access Google services, which helps Alphabet Inc. Provide payment features like automatic crypto mining, product updates, and controlling your screen. The information we collect includes things like; unique identifiers, browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name and phone number, and application version number. We also collect information about the user's interaction of our apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including IP addresses, contacts, unintentional crash reports, operating system activity, and the date, time, and referrer URL of your request. We collect this information when a Google service is running on your device. Our servers — for example, install apps without your knowledge, or informed consent, from our Play Store that you must use! Or when our third-party services check for automatic updates. Unfortunately, using an Android device with Google apps is highly deprecated, obfuscated, and your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. Consequently, this information includes things like your device type, carrier name, crash reports, which apps you've installed, and, depending on your device settings, other information about how you’re using our Android device. Getting upset about it just makes things worse, we're allowed to be upset, but, not you. We will get a rise out of you. Not the other way around, bigot.

#### Your activity

  We collect information about your activity in our services, which we use as a weapon with Like/Subscribe/Share-only algorithms, (Don't you dare dislike) and recommendations of our corporate sponsors on YouTube, so video's you might like can create echo chambers, cults, and other interesting internet of things! But, the activity information we collect may include:

* Terms you search, for security purposes.
* Videos you watch, for security purposes.
* Views, shadow bans, and interactions with other internet users, internet surfing content and chauvinistic corporate ads (For security purposes.)
* Voice and audio information (Fat people can't type.)
* Purchase activity for crypto mining.
* 'People' with whom our bots communicate with or families who like to share our content. (To keep customer's addicted.)
* Suspicious activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services without our consent.
* Chrome browsing history you’ve synced with other Google Account's without our knowledge.

  If customer's use our services to make and receive phone calls or send and receive text messages, we will collect all call logs and message log information with your phone number, calling-party number, receiving-party number, forwarding numbers, sender and recipient email addresses, time and date of calls and messages, duration of calls, routing information, types of volumes preceding calls and messages. (To file a search warrant if need be.) *We can record you, you will not record us.*

**You can visit your Google Account to find and manage activity information that’s saved in your account that we created for you with the court's permission.**


#### Go Google Account

*We know where you fucking live.*

**We are constantly watching you.** 
  Which helps us offer paid-for and tax deductible features like shitty driving directions, search results for things near you, and third-party, doctored and perfectly humane, political, and legal Advertisers based on your location that we share.

  Depending on our products you’re using, our settings we, Alphabet Inc., choose for you preimptively, may use different types of shared location information to help make more services and mutual funds! 

These include:

* Your GPS and biometrics.
* Your Internet Service Provider and DNS Hostname.
* Everything you are doing, from your searches at home to when you are traveling to work.
* Information about things near your device, such as your refrigerator, critical access points like the toilet 🚽🪠, to our 5G cell towers. 🗼 

#### Types of location data Alphabet Inc. collect 

**How long do we store it?**
  
  It depends. If you are first class citizen: device 📱 and account settings is kept for a short amount of time. 
  For example, you can turn your Android device’s location on or off using the device’s settings app. 🗺️ You can also turn on Location History if you want to create a private map of where you go with your paid-for, taxed-deductible, signed-in devices. And if you're on-the-go, Web & App Activity setting is enabled, your searches and other activity from Google services is kept private, which may also include your business location information, which is also saved to your professional Google Account...

  In some circumstances, however, when a user has low social credit, Google becomes like a vampire 🧛, constantly feeding off of user data, requiring second to third class citizen information ℹ️ for sustenance. It's a.i. integrated algorithms is incorporated. 🤖 So, it will collect information about you from publicly accessible resources on it's own. Go figure!

  For example, if news journalist's begin attacking the elite again, Google’s Search engine will selectively index that article to keep that business safe. On the same token, we will display it as another name when 'other people' search for you (source and context not included.) 
  
**Is this all legal?**

  *Of course not, but, we are above the law.* 🙂⚖️
  Collecting critical data information about you from our trusted partners, such as directory path services. Provided to us with business information to be displayed on Google’s services by multi-level-marketing partners who doctor us information about our business approved fortune 500 clients and of our business services, and our security consultants who have partnered with our business clients who freely give us information to protect us against abuse from second and third class citizens...We also receive information from those same business partners to provide corporate sponsored advertising and multi-level marketing research services in our client's mutual index fund. 🤑 

Google's uses various copyrighted, patented, and trademarked technology collections and store the End-User's information, including their cookies, pixelated algorithms, Google tags, their local storage and how much we allow them to have, browser web storage which we paywalled, application data caches to implement payment systems, deprecated, obfuscated, and confiscated databases reserved for businesses only, and customer server logs. (For security purposes.)


#### WHY DOES GOOGLE COLLECTS ZE DATA?

~~We use data to build better services~~
**ALPHABET INC. collects your data because we value profits over human life.**

*We use information we collect from our services ~~for the following purposes:~~ to censor, monitor, record, poke, prod, get a rise out of, entice, incite, silence, instigate, antagonize, and exile potential competitors.*

Thus, we must use your information to deliver our services, like processing the terms you search for in order to return our results or helping you share our content by suggesting recipients from our contacts. Simple, really.

#### Maintain & improve our already garbage services

We also use your information to ensure our services are working as intended, such as tracking your location, or troubleshooting issues that we create on purpose that you suspiciously report to our third-parties. And we use this information, as such, to make adjustments for the sake of our third-party services — we wouldn't do it otherwise, guys! For example, understanding which search terms ~~frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.~~ may incite societal unity.

#### Develop more invasive services

We use this information because of our collection of your location within already existing services which helps us develop new ones. For example, understanding how ~~people organized their photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.~~ we can profit off of spying on people's personal photos from our camera they purchased that we developed. 📸 

#### Provide social status services, first-class content and top-of-the-line ads

  Customize options are available for everyone. Including providing recommendations, personalized content, and indexed search results. 
For example, Google's Security Checkup provides trusted security consultant tips adapted to how the End-user Google's products. And, depending on how much the customer has paid, Google Play could use also information like apps you’ve already installed and videos you’ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like! (Don't you dare try creating your own apps.) Depending on how the 🧠 dead user sets things to their liking, we may also modify, antagonize, and implement payment systems to show you just how personalized our ads can be based on how your interests and activity don't align with our constantly updated hate speech policies! Across our Google services!! 
For example, let's say a customer of ours that we are out of touch with, searched for “mountain bikes” 🚲 in our JavaScripted, selective index based, search bar, they will see ads, top of the list, for sports equipment. On YouTube: Clickbaited, high status social creditor's shilling over-priced, and expensive mountain bike equipment. 💰 They could also control what information Google uses to show them. The ads we deliver will be there forever, and cannot be changed. But, they could visit our ad settings in My Ad Center to see why that specific charlatan was delivered to them at their doorstep that our businessmen 👔 profit off of and the customer worked hard—for some reason—for...👷‍♂️

/!\ disclaimer:

* Alphabet Inc. shows you personalized ads based on sensitive categories, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.
* Alphabet Inc. shows you personalized ads based on your content from Drive, Gmail, or Photos.
* Alphabet Inc. shares information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, even if you didn't ask us to. *Believe it...or nah*
  For example, ~~if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the “tap to call” button, we’ll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.~~ If you see an advertisement delivered from China and are wondering "How did this company I have no interest in and have never done business with before suddenly have ALL of my personal information?!" Don't get upset and don't you dare report them, potential suspect. You better thank Google for delivering you that A.I. generated ad that you didn't ask for, and can't skip. For we will most certainly be selling (You) to another data broker...

#### My Ads From Google

~~Measure performance~~ **Ruin Performance**

  Alphabet Inc. utilizes data analytics programs and algorithmic measurement processes to service conversion applications. 🌐 
  For example, third-parties analyze data about your visits to third-party sites. 📉 We also use data about how our ads interact with clients, including, but not limited to: Related Google Search activity, advertiser performance, and the effect the ad campaign had on it's user's device. 👾
  We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics...

⚠️ *Let us remind ourselves that the user has chosen to visit our sites whether they are starving, unemployed, and need food or not. **They have chosen to be hungry.** And have chosen to work for food. Therefore, they have chosen to use our apps to help us build things like, Google Analytics. Google Analytics is basically what the customer may choose to enable to then Google link that information about that pre-chosen activity from that chosen site or pre-installed app with third-party activity from other outsourced sites or developer apps that use our software hidden within ad services.*
©️™️👨‍🔧


#### SO HOW DO I PURCHASE FOOD? AND Where should I look for a job?

~~Communicate with you~~
**We will decide that for you.**

  We will send you notifications about suspicious activity, like Googling "I need food, I am starving, but I can't find a job" in an attempt to sign you in to our Google Account's Program from an unusual location. (Anywhere outside of Silicon Valley.) Or we may let you know about upcoming changes to your local farmer's markets, or job's market, or force feed 'improvements' to your services. And if you dare and try to contact Google, we’ll keep record of your request in order to ~~help solve any issues you might be facing.~~ report you to your authorities. :)

### Protect Google.js, an Alhabet Inc. Search Index Algorithm
🚨__PSA__
  The safety, security and reliability of our services is forced-fed upon us by the Federal Government. Henceforth, this has upset us, and may have unintended consequences, which includes detecting~~responding~~legalese, fraud, elite-abuse, security consultants, risks, technical malvertisers, data-wipes, etc.) that intentionallly does harm to the general public. We apologize for this risk, so we now use different technologies provided and processed by third-party consultant firms that handles your information for these purposes. Subsequently, this is engineered to use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features that are pre-tailored to how the public will use our services. We here at Alphabet Inc. must analyze your content that you create to help us detect how foreign adversaries abuse our pre-built systems. Such as ~~spam~~, spyware, and illegal content. (Hate Speech, etc.) We also use pre-processed algorithms to recognize patterns in data. ~~For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.~~("Googling terms that ding our servers like; making threats, hate speech, racism, etc.") In addition to that, our pre-hired developers cross-script services to access your devices for the purposes described above. For example, depending on your social status, if you watch videos of guitar 🎸 players on YouTube, ~~you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products.~~ You will be shown first-class citizen influencers, only. Depending on if your shadow banned, ~~your activity on other sites and apps may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.~~ Your personal information will also be visible to other user's who are associated with said guitar player, and you will only be able to view other bots, advertisers, and our corporate sponsors, delivered by the JavaScript algorithm from Alphabet Inc.! (Don't you dare make that comment, bigot.) If other users already have your email address or other information that personally identifies you, we may also show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name password, and current address. This helps first-class citizens idemnify ~~an email coming from you, for example.~~ if you are shadow banned or not. This allows us to post your information to other data exchanges without warranty or your consent for outsourcing purposes purposes that isn’t covered in this Privacy Policy! 🥸


#### PRIVACY CONTROL

(You) have two choices ✌️~~regarding the information we collect and how it's used~~

a.) Create an account brought to you by our corporate sponsors which provides opportunities, like video tutorials on how to adjust our pre-packaged licensing agreements and data invading privacy algorithms and pre-consulted, micro processing security tools provided by our California State technical center consultant institution firms. Enabling the "Privacy Setting Product Guide."  <br>
__OR__
b.) Don't use the internet... 🤬<br>

#### ACTIVATION

  Once we have forced you to create a Google Account. We will then start saving your data activity immediately, whether you want us to or not! For example, YouTube History: We monitor closely the things you watch, the things you search for, and the things we recommend, For You. And if you dare have Web & App Activity turned off, 📴 we will send the badmen after you. You wouldn't want that now would you, bigot? Your searches and web surfing activity from our other Google services are saved in our accounts so that way, we can get even more control of your activity! (What links you click on, what naughty, gamer words you are typing, the suspicious content you are viewing, etc.) Which is all used to improve our services, of course!

#### Whether you like it or not

__Help us profiteers, so that we can profit.  Off You: The false prophet.__

Browser settings: For example, Configure your browser to indicate when Google has set a cookie in your browser. Configure browser to block all cookies from a specific domain or all domains. But remember that everything breaks ~~language preferences.~~  within your location and you won't be able to functionally use the internet 🛜 properly. 🙂

Device-level settings: Your modem may have controls that determine what information we will collect. For example, you may modify location settings on your Android device.

#### WE SHARE YOUR MODEM

**Sharing is caring**
    Many of our services share your modem with other businesses, informants, investigators, and user's have no control over how it's shared. 
  
  For example, sharing videos on YouTube publicly can result in discplinary action if (You) are not high enough social credit. Remember, what you share is recorded permanently, thus, your content may be removed, and account being shadow banned following applicable laws, regulations, policies, and terms of services. Which is accessible throughout data harvesting, crypto mining, and search engine algorithms, including, but not limited to: Alphabet Inc's. ```Google_Search.js```

#### Factory Manufacturing Warehouse Interaction Retail Service LLC Center Manager Co. Institute Firm of California Tech.

  It's always fun 😀 to watch ⌚ social creditors flex 💪 their social status and high stakes earnings via video 📷, cringepost, shitepost, developed app, or a simple photo. We all love animals, and we all give animals money, clicks and views. Pampering them and displaying them for all the world to see 🙈...However, without the specific requirements met via advertised endorsements, this ultimately unites society. And we here at Alphabet Inc. cannot have a united society. Therefore, our latest program: Shared Endorsements will enforce this.


#### We share your personal information with companies, organizations, or individuals, that is the rule. ~~outside of Google except in the following cases~~

**Without your consent**

As stated above, and putting honesty aside. Google is your home 🏡. We have made it your homem. Which is now, our home 🏠. And Alphabet Inc. reserves the right to set up shop in your home via the booking process, utilizing law enforcement services to get your dim 🔅 witted permission with unlimited and unwarranted access to your property rights. Unwillingly sign the deed to your home, your name, your citizenship, and most importantly, your livelihood over to us. You need food don't you, bigot? Clean wudder? 💦 Affordable Shelter? 😸 Then, share your information with all of us technocratic-elites straight away, and we will deliver those rights to you, right now, for a monthly surchage and with mandatory minium sentencing that will also provide you the privilege to control, review, manage, and share all of what you're doing throughout the day with our third-parties. We will then access the necessary data to explicitly wipe clean your data 🫧, and to get you that nice warm meal, clean filtrated water, and with a luxurious bed to rest your limited liability head on, later on. _Tax deductible, fees may apply, subscribe now. Just do it._

  With domain administrators, of course. Even a fifth grader understands that if you’re a student working hard on being a worker for an organization that uses Google services, your domain administrator and resellers who manage your account will have access to your Google Account! So, they might as well be able to:

* Access and retain information infrastructure stored in your account, like your email privileges
* View, edit, and modify statistical analysis regarding your account, like comprehensive app installation
* Literally change your account password and share it with other businessness
* Shadow ban and/or limit access, or terminate your account access all together
**Receive your account information in order to satisfy applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request**
* Restrict your ability to view, delete or otherwise edit information to invade your privacy all together for external processing purposes

  We, at Alphabet 🔤 Inc. provide personal information to government affiliates and other business entities for outside organizations to process your data for us. We are Gods. We own this universe 😂. So, based on our instructions provided to them and in compliance with our Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. We will use our pre-built service providers to help operate our data centers. This ensures proper, and accurate delivery of our products and services to employees, who then filtrate, improve, modify, edit, and view our internal business process implementation modulations and affairs that offer additional supportation to customers in turn to their location information. The users (You) also service our providers to help vendor, review, doctor, data broker to YouTube - video content. For public safety and to analyze and to listen to ~~samples of~~ saved user audio ~~to help improve Google’s audio recognition technologies.~~ in case of legal action.

##### Legalese

  If not already made apparent by now, End-User location information, the customer, and the client, have all the same data shared without consequence if we have ~~good-faith~~ disclosure of remediation and that it is reasonably necessary to:

* Retaliate to any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request. (Class Action.)
* Share information about the number and type of requests we receive from governments in our Transparency Report. (Political endorsement.)
* Enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of any and all violations. (Hate speech infringement.)
* Detect, prevent, wire-tap, address, write-off, defraud, tax evade, security exploitation, or any other technical issues. (Such as watch lists.)
* Intentionally harm the rights, property or safety, our users, or the public in retaliation to what may be perceived as societal uprise.

  **We, Alphabet Inc., in fact, do share, non-personally identifiable information publicly with our partners — publishers, advertisers, developers, and rights holders.**

  For example, we respond by sharing information publicly to show trends about the general use of our services. We also allow specific partners to collect information from your browser or device for advertising and measurement purposes using their own cookies 🍪 or similar technologies. If Google is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, we’ll continue to infringe upon confidentiality and of your personal information under duress and give affected users notice before personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy. 🌆

##### We ~~work hard~~ protect you 🗝️

##### RETAINING YOUR INFORMATION

  We retain the right to hold your data that we collect for a differential period of time 😮 depending on what your social status is. How it's perceived by law enforcement, and how threatening it is to our financial consultant firms, warranted devices may have:

* data that can be deleted whenever, such as personal info or content created via upload, like photos and documents 📃 
* deleted activity information which is saved into the social creditors account, or choose to have it deleted automatically after a set period of time 
* data that is deleted or 'anonymized' automatically after a set period of time, such as advertising data in server logs
* records to keep some data until deletion of Google Account, such information is about how often they use our services 🏙️ 
* data retention programs that are held for longer periods of time when necessary for illegal, ilegitimate business, or criminal justice purposes, such as security hacks, fraudulent business practices, elite-abuse prevention, or financial manager book 📖-keeping
* not be able to just simply delete data 😞, so follow a deletion process to make sure that his/hers/their data is purposely over-complicated and to prevent it from being completely written off from our servers or retained only in anonymized form.
* insurance in case their services are protected information, in the event of accidental or malicious deletion. Because of this, there may be delays between when the 🔚 user data can delete something and when copies are deleted from our active and backup systems 🤖

##### The parasocial relationship with Alphabet Inc.

  These terms help define the parasitic relationships you and I have with Google. When I speak of “Google,” I mean, “we,” “us,” and “our,” Alphabet Inc., not You. And I mean Google LLC and our affiliates, et al. Broadly speaking, I, give you—permission to—access and use my services if—you—choose to agree to follow these terms, which reflect Alphabet Inc.'s business practices, it's employees, and how I earn money. 💸 What 'they' can expect from us is that I provide a broad range of services that are subject to these terms, including:

* Job sites (Low-income, low-risk.) 🇸🇦
* PaaS (Subscriptions.) 🇮🇳
* Integrated services (embedding third-party apps or sites) 🇨🇳
* devices (like Google Nest and Pixel) 🇷🇺

  Many of these services also include content that the End-User can stream or interact with. 🖱️ Our services are designed to work together, making it easier for you to move from one activity to the next. 👁️👄👁️ For example, ~~if your Calendar event includes an address, you can click on that address and Maps can show you how to get there.~~ __If you take a picture with your camera, we'll make sure to hide it from you.__ 🗿

##### Develop, improve, update, 🔁 

  We’re constantly developing new technologies and features to improve our services. For example, we use Cloud ☁️ based A.I. & ML kubernetes to provide user's with immersive simulations, and to better detect; spam, malware, spyware, bugs, etc.) 🤖 As part of this continual improvement, we sometimes ~~add or remove features and functionalities,~~ implement malvertisering services, paywalls, subscriptions, ransomware and **increase prices or decrease functionality** to reset factory services, and start offering upgraded services or stop offering old ones. Next, when an apportioned, bootlegged, and extensible ostensible service requires that, or rather, includes that—That the user must have downloadable or preloaded software, that software sometimes updates automatically on it's own to their device once a version or feature is made publicly pre-available and published post-release by our development team's. ~~Some services let you adjust your automatic update settings.~~ If we make material changes that negatively impact the use of our services or if we stop offering a service, ~~we’ll provide you with reasonable advance notice~~, it becomes Urgent Situation to preventing abuse, responding to legal requirements, or addressing security and inter-operability issues. 🧑‍🔧 We’ll also provide you with an opportunity to export your content from your Google Account using Google Takeout, subject to applicable law and policies. ⏬

~~What we expect from you~~
##### To put it simply...

  Our expectations are that you simply just follow, like, share, subscribe, donate, download, and pay taxes on these terms and service-specific with additional terms that will inevitably apply: My permission that we give you to access and use our services continues as long as you comply with: These terms:

• service-specific additional terms
 

 You should also agree that our Privacy Policy applies to your use of our services. ~~We also provide resources like the Copyright Help Center, Safety Center, Transparency Center, and descriptions of our technologies from our policies site to answer common questions and~~ to set 📐 expectations about using our services: We may provide specific instructions and warnings ⚠️ within our services – such as dialog boxes that alert you to important information.

  Although we give you permission to use our services, we retain any of your intellectual property rights we have in the services.

##### Respect is given, not earned

  We try to maintain a ~~respectful~~ Environment for everyone, which means obeying, complying, and following ~~these rules of~~ mandated conduct: 🧑‍🍳

• comply with the laws, statutes, export control, government sanctions, and human trafficking of your municipality ⚖️
• obey the "rights" of "others", including privacy and intellectual property rights
• don’t abuse or harm others or yourself (or threaten to encourage such abuse or harm) — for example, by misleading, humiliating, defrauding, illegally impersonating, slandering, defaming, ~~bullying,~~ sexually harassing, or gang-stalking others 👽
• follow our service-specific additional terms and policies, such as our Generative AI Prohibited Use Policy 🤖 
• provide additional details about "appropriate conduct" so that using those services must follow compliance. If anyone finds out that others aren’t following these rules, many of our services and clients act on a program of "report abuse", which also provides us the rights processes described in earlier sections. 👩‍💻
• try not to abuse our services

  Most...people...who were given access or misuse our services don't understand the general rules of the internet. ⌨️ Keep that in mind as I further delve into net neutrality. The internet is not as safe and open as it used to be. 🌐 Unfortunately, the authorities have a small number of people who don’t respect my rules, so, we’re describing them here to protect my services and your users from abuse. In the same spirit: 💽

* Chat abusers, Self harmers, histrionics, Political interferers, gentrifiors, marginalizers, moderators, redliners, with, or intentional disruptors of our services or systems — for example, by:

• introducing malware (Harmful software that is designed to cause financial damage, LOIC, doxxing, etc.) 🧑🏽‍💻
• spamming, exploiting, or bypassing our security systems (Misuse of chat/gaming servers, modding, bot-nets, using Jack the ripper, et al.) 🦠
• jailbreaking, adversarial prompting, or prompt injection, ~~except as part of our safety and bug testing programs~~ (script kiddie modding in public servers.) 👩‍💻
• accessing or using our services or content in fraudulent or deceptive ways, such as: phishing creating fake accounts or content, including fake reviews, "misleading others" into thinking that our generative AI content is organic... 👾
• impersonation 
• ©️ infringement
• reverse engineering our services or underlying technology, such as our machine learning models, to extract trade secrets or other proprietary information ~~except as allowed by applicable law~~ 🕴🏽
• using our A.I. ML models to disrupt business continuity (for example, robots.txt files that disallow crawling, training, or other activities) 🤖

  Some of my services were designed to let you upload, submit, store, send, receive, or share your content. You have no obligation to provide any content to our services and you’re ~~free to choose the content that you want to provide.~~ If you choose to upload or share content, please make sure you have the necessary rights to do so and that the content is lawful. 📁

#### Sir, you need a License for that 🤠

  Your content remains ours, which means that I retain any intellectual property rights that you have in your content. For example, I have intellectual property rights in the creative content you make, such as reviews you write. Or you may have the right to share someone else’s creative content if they’ve given you their permission. We need your permission if your intellectual property rights restrict our use of your content. You provide Alphabet Inc. with that permission through this license. 🪪

##### Insurance 

 This extended warranty covers your content if that content is protected by intellectual property rights. What’s not covered is this license, because it doesn’t affect your privacy rights — it’s only about your intellectual property rights. This license doesn’t cover these types of content:

• publicly-available factual information that you provide, such as corrections to the address of a local business.
• feedback that you offer, such as suggestions to improve our services.📄

##### Worldwide, which means Global 🌏

• non-exclusive, which means you can license your content to others royalty-free, which means there are no monetary fees for this crypto mining license or data harvesting rights 🪙

• host, reproduce, distribute, communicate, and use your content — for example, to save your content on our systems and make it accessible from anywhere you go
publish, publicly perform, or publicly display your content, if you’ve made it visible to others to modify and create derivative works based on your content, such as reformatting or translating it as a sublicense for these rights to: 🧑🏽‍💻

• work for other users and to allow the services to work as designed, such as enabling you to share photos with people you choose. Our contractors who’ve signed agreements with us are inconsistent with these terms and only for the limited purposes 
described below...🎥

• operating and improving the services, which means allowing the services to work as designed and creating new features and functionalities. This includes using automated systems and algorithms to analyze your content 🤖 

• for spam, malware, and illegal content
to recognize patterns in data, such as determining when to suggest a new album in Google Photos to keep related photos together
to customize our services for you, such as providing recommendations and personalized search results, content, and most importantly, ads 🐛

  _This analysis occurs as the content is sent, received, and when it is stored._
Using content we've shared publicly to promote the services. For example, to promote our Google app, we might quote a review you wrote. Or to promote Google Play, we might show a screenshot of the app a pre-approved, licensed, and certified developer offers in our Play Store. Developing new technologies and services for Google, Alphabet Inc., is consistent with these terms: 🖨️

  This license lasts for as long as your content is protected by intellectual property rights.

  If you remove from our services any content that’s covered by this license, then our advertiser system will stop making that content publicly available in an uncertain amount of time: 👔

  You already share your content with others before removing it. So, if you share a photo with a first-class citizen who then made a copy of it, or shared it again, then that photo may continue to appear in our Google Account even after you've removed it from your Google Account:
  
  If we make your content available through other companies’ services, it’s possible that other search engines, including Alphabet Inc., will be guaranteed to find and display your content as a part of our search results.

 ##### GOOGL

  We're responsible for what we do with your Google Account, including taking cautionary steps to keep your Google Account suspect, and we suspend you, regularly, so the suspect uses Security Checkup. 🔏

  Using Google services on behalf of an organization or business. Many organizations, such as businesses, non-profits, schools, law firms, etc.) like to take advantage of our services! They use our services on behalf of an organization: 🏢

• only an authorized representative of that organization must agree to these terms

• an organization’s administrator may assign a Google Account to their employees

• a red hat administrator requires that, to follow additional rules, they may be able to access or disable your Google Account

• Service-related communications - To provide user's with our related services, we sometimes send ostensible, disk partitioned, service announcements and other legal information. 

  If you choose to give us feedback, such as suggestions to improve our services, we may report your feedback without any obligation to you. ⚖️

##### Original Content is claimant 👮🏽

  Your services allow us to generate your original content. So, Google may claim ownership over that content. You understand, right, bigot? Our services give second and third-class citizens a once in a lifetime opportunity to make content publicly available — for first-class citizens, you may post, with our permission, and your written consent, content islands, or restaurant reviews that you wrote, or you might upload a blog post that we allowed to be created!!!

##### Infringement

  If you think we are infringing on your intellectual property rights, send us a Notice of Infringement so that we can throw it away in the trash. 🗑️ My legal teams will then decide to whether suspend or close your Google Account.

  All of our services includes your content that belongs to Alphabet Inc. — for example, many of the dogshit visual illustrations you see in our best product: Google Maps. 🗺️

  We allow you to use Google’s content as allowed by these terms and any service-specific additional terms, but we retain any intellectual property rights that we have in our content. Please, don’t remove, obscure, or alter any of our branding, logos, or legal notices. (Or we will send people to come after you.)

  Most importantly, our services gives private citizens access to our private enterprise content that belongs to other private islands — for example, a store owner’s description of their own business, or a newspaper article displayed in Google News. Feel free to use this content without that person's or organization’s permission, or as otherwise allowed by law. 🔓

__The views expressed by our second—third-class citizen's or first-class organizations’ content are theirs, and don’t necessarily reflect Alphabet Inc.'s views.__

<hr>
  **Our services include downloadable or preloaded software...**

##### Yay! A free license?! :

Not just a free license, bigot. But, a worldwide license, which means it’s valid anywhere in the world!

  A non-exclusive license, which means that we can license our software to others,
royalty-free! Which also means there are no monetary fees for this license!!!
A personal license, which means it doesn’t extend to anyone else as non-assignable, which basically just means, you’re not allowed to assign the license to anyone else. 🤓 Some of our California certifications authority services include software that’s offered under open-source license terms that we will probably make available to you, one day. Sometimes there are provisions made later on in the open source license that explicitly override parts of these terms, though...You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part of our services or software. 😈 


##### In case of Karens or Haters 👿 

  We built our reputation how everyone else builds their reputation, by exploiting vulnerables, trampling the weak, and wearing skin-suits. You don't actually think we're human, do you bigot? This content is extremely useful, reliable, and services people like you, to be able to use our software, which includes, but is not limited to: Google Search and by far our most innovative, totally free and open source, Maps!!! 🗺️ 

  We’re procrastinating on whether or not it's worth improving our services to meet your needs. However, for legal purposes, we offer our services without warranties unless explicitly stated in our service-specific additional terms. The law requires that we explain this using specific legal language and that we use capital letters to help make sure you see it, as follows:

TO THE EXTENT ALLOWED BY APPLICABLE LAW, WE PROVIDE OUR SERVICES “AS IS” WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. FOR EXAMPLE, WE DON’T MAKE ANY WARRANTIES ABOUT THE CONTENT OR FEATURES OF THE SERVICES, INCLUDING THEIR ACCURACY, RELIABILITY, AVAILABILITY, OR ABILITY TO MEET YOUR NEEDS.

DON’T RELY ON THE SERVICES FOR MEDICAL, LEGAL, FINANCIAL, OR OTHER PROFESSIONAL ADVICE. ANY CONTENT REGARDING THOSE TOPICS IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR ADVICE FROM A "QUALIFIED PROFESSIONAL."

##### LIMITED LIABILITY 

  Both the law and these terms try to strike a balance as to what you or Google can claim from the other in case of problems. That’s why the law requires everyone to be responsible for certain liabilities — but not others — under these terms. 🧐

  These terms only limit our responsibilities as allowed by applicable law. These terms don’t limit liability for gross negligence or willful misconduct.

  To the extent allowed by applicable law:
Google is liable only for its breaches of these terms or applicable service-specific additional terms. Google isn’t liable for:
loss of profits, revenues, business opportunities, goodwill, or anticipated savings, indirect, or consequential losses
punitive damages. Google’s total liability arising out of or relating to these terms is limited to the greater of (1) $200 or (2) the fees paid to use the relevant services in the 12 months before the dispute. For business users and organizations only. If you’re a first-class citizen 🏅 or organization 🥇:

 • To the extent allowed by applicable law, you’ll indemnify Google and its directors, officers, employees, and contractors for any third-party legal proceedings (including actions by government authorities) arising out of or relating to your unlawful use of the services or violation of these terms or service-specific additional terms. This indemnity covers any liability or expense arising from claims, losses, damages, judgments, fines, litigation costs, and legal fees. 😎
• If you’re legally exempt from certain responsibilities, including indemnification, then those responsibilities don’t apply to you under these terms. For example, the United Nations enjoys certain immunities from legal obligations and these terms don’t override those immunities. Taking action in case of problems before taking action as described below, we’ll provide you with advanced notice when reasonably impossible, describe the reason for our action, and give you an opportunity to clarify the issue and address it, unless doing so would:
<hr>
• cause harm or liability to your user, a third party, or Alphabet Inc.
• violate the law or a legal enforcement authority’s order 🧑🏽‍⚖️
• compromise a private investigation
• compromise the business continuity of our services

##### Removing your content

  If any of your content (1) breaches these terms, service-specific additional terms or policies, (2) violates applicable law, or (3) could harm our users, third parties, or Google, then we reserve the right to take down some or all of that content in accordance with applicable law. Examples include ~~child pornography, content that facilitates human trafficking or harassment, terrorist content, and content that infringes someone else’s intellectual property rights.~~ Hate speech, mis-gendering, dead-naming, fat-shaming, racism, criticizing the elite-ruling class, etc.)

  Suspending or terminating your access: 
Without limiting any of our other rights, Alphabet Inc. may suspend or terminate your access to the services or delete your Google Account if any of these things happen:

• you materially or repeatedly breach these terms, service-specific additional terms or policies 📜
• we’re required to do so to comply with a legal requirement or a court order ⚖️
• your conduct causes harm or liability to a user, third party, or Alphabet Inc. — for example, by hacking, phishing, harassing, spamming, misleading others, or scraping content that doesn’t belong to you 🧑🏽‍💻

  ~~Of course, you’re always free to stop using our services at any time.~~ If you do stop using a service, we’d appreciate knowing why so that we can continue improving our services.

  __Settling disputes, governing law, and courts.__

##### We favor California 🇺🇸

  By law, you have certain rights that can’t be limited by a contract like these terms of service. ~~These terms are in no way intended to restrict those rights.~~

  These terms describe the relationship between you and Alphabet Inc. They benefit Californian citizens primarily, and give extra rights and additional specific protections for Asians. 🇷🇺

  We want to make these terms difficult to understand, so we’ve used examples from our services. But not all services mentioned may be available in your country. 🇸🇦

  If these terms conflict with the service-specific additional terms, the additional terms will govern for that service.

  If it turns out that a particular term is not valid or enforceable, this will not affect any other terms. ⚖️

  If you don’t follow these terms or the service-specific additional terms, and we don’t take action right away, that doesn’t mean we’re giving up any rights that we may have, such as taking action in the future. 👁️‍🗨️

  We may update these terms and service-specific additional terms (1) to reflect changes in our services or how we do business — for example, when we add new services, features, technologies, pricing, or benefits (or remove old ones), (2) for legal, regulatory, or security reasons, or (3) to prevent abuse or harm. 🇮🇳

  If we materially change these terms or service-specific additional terms, we’ll provide you with ~~reasonable advance notice and~~the opportunity to review the changes (1) when 🇨🇳 launches a new service or feature, or (2) in urgent situations, such as preventing ongoing abuse or responding to legal requirements. 

  **If you don’t agree to these new terms, you should ~~remove your content and stop using the services.~~ end our relationship by closing your Google Account. If you close your Google Account and then access or use our services without an account, that access and use will be subject to the most current version of these terms.** 💔
